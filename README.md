# Voxel 1993
A basic 3d engine written in C++ like it's Doom 1993. All the rendering is done manually (nothing fancy like using OpenGL for the 3d rendering).
Though it still uses OpenGL for the window creation and input handling. Goal is to have a simple 3d engine capable of rendering a 3d voxel world.

## Building
Project is setup to use CMake. To build the project first create a build directory and run CMake. Then run make to build the project.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
bear -- make # For generating compile_commands.json
```

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Contains all the source code for the project
- `include/` - Contains all the header files for the project
- `textures/` - Contains all the textures used in the project 
- `build/` - Contains the build files generated by CMake

## Features

### Rendering
Rendering is currently done using a Z-Buffering algorithm. Later I plan to combine this with a Voxel Octree
in combination with multi-threading to render the world. Z-Buffering will prevent overdraw while using multi-threading.
- [x] ~~Painters algorithm for rendering (antioptimization)~~
- [ ] Z-Buffering for rendering (partially implemented)
- [ ] Voxel Octree

### Chunking System
World is going to be split into chunks for better performance of size 8x8x8. 
- [ ] Single chunk
- [ ] Chunking system
- [ ] Multi-threaded chunk queue management

### World Generation
World is going to be generated using Perlin Noise. Later planning to implement a combination of noises.
- [ ] Perlin Noise
- [ ] Create world using Perlin Noise
- [ ] Combine multiple noises

### Loading/Saving
World is going to be split into segments made up of chunks.
- [ ] Basic load/save system
- [ ] World segmentation
